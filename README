ACS VM library and standalone interpreter. Intended to be suitable for use in
Doom-based video game engines to implement Hexen ACS or ZDoom ACS bytecode
execution. It is focused on being usable for implementing existing extensions
and new functions (whether through new instructions or CallFunc indexes) while
having performance suitable to the complex ACS-based mods that have come into
existence.
